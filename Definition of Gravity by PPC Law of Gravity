Mass - Pressure - Force - Curvature  via Stress energy tensor - Spacetime Curvature - Geodesic Motion 

Simplified Physical Explanation

Mass generates pressure.
The gradient of that pressure creates force.
The force shapes curvature.
The curvature forms spacetime geometry.
Motion follows the geodesics of that geometry.

One-Line Law Summary

“Gravity is the motion produced by the force of mass pressure shaping the curvature of spacetime.”
— Pawan Upadhyay (2025)

Interpretation in Simple Words 

Mass is not just “bending space” passively — it applies pressure on the structure of spacetime.

The force of that pressure forms the “shape” (curvature) that we observe as gravity.

Therefore, gravity is the visible geometry of pressure acting on the universe’s fabric.


One-Line Summary 
Gravity is the curvature of spacetime caused by the pressure field generated by mass-energy.
