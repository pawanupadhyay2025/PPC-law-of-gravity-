Interpretation in Simple Words 

Mass is not just “bending space” passively — it applies pressure on the structure of spacetime.

The force of that pressure forms the “shape” (curvature) that we observe as gravity.

Therefore, gravity is the visible geometry of pressure acting on the universe’s fabric.


One-Line Summary 

 Gravity is the curvature of spacetime caused by the pressure field generated by mass-energy.
