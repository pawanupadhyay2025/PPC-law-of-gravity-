Interstellar Objects in the Universe and the PPC Law of Gravity 

Interstellar objects—such as rogue planets, free-floating asteroids, and interstellar visitors like 1I/‘Oumuamua—move through the universe without being permanently bound to a single stellar system. Their trajectories are shaped by large-scale gravitational environments rather than by a single central mass.

Within Pawan Upadhyay’s Pressure–Curvature Law of Gravity (PPC Law), the motion of interstellar objects is interpreted as a response to gravitational pressure fields generated by mass density. Stars, galaxies, and galaxy clusters generate gravitational pressure that curves spacetime, while interstellar objects follow geodesic motion through regions of varying pressure and curvature.
When pressure gradients are weak, spacetime curvature becomes nearly flat, allowing objects to move freely across interstellar or intergalactic space. Temporary encounters with high-pressure regions—such as near stars or dense molecular clouds—can deflect trajectories or lead to temporary capture. Time-dependent variations in these pressure fields generate pressure–curvature waves, which can induce small perturbations, especially in low-mass interstellar bodies.
Thus, in PPC gravity, interstellar objects serve as natural probes of the large-scale pressure structure of the universe, moving through transitions between low-pressure and high-pressure regions of spacetime.

# One-line summary : #

In PPC gravity, interstellar objects travel along geodesics shaped by large-scale gravitational pressure fields, responding to variations in pressure and curvature across the universe.
