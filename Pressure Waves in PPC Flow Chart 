 Vertical Flow (Top → Bottom):

1️⃣ Mass (ρ)
→ 
(Mass generates Pressure)

2️⃣ Pressure Field
→ 
(Pressure produces Force)

3️⃣ Force of Pressure
→ 
(Force influences Stress–Energy Tensor)

4️⃣ Curvature via Stress–Energy Tensor
→ 

5️⃣ Curvature of Spacetime
→ 
(Defines geometry of space)

6️⃣ Geodesic Motion
→ 
(Objects follow curvature paths)

7️⃣ Pressure Waves (Gravitational Waves)
→ 
(Dynamic curvature oscillations — waves of pressure in spacetime)


Bottom Caption:

Mass → Pressure → Force → Curvature → Spacetime → Motion → Pressure Waves
