Pawan Upadhyay’s Pressure–Curvature Law of Gravity



📖 Abstract

This research presents a new, physically intuitive understanding of gravity: Mass creates pressure, and the pressure of mass is the cause of spacetime curvature.

The Pressure–Curvature Law of Gravity (PPC Law) reveals that gravity is not a mysterious attraction nor merely a geometric warping, but the direct consequence of a pressure field generated by mass-energy acting upon the fabric of spacetime.

Mass → Pressure → Curvature → Motion

The curvature of spacetime is the geometric expression of this pressure force.


 Concept Overview

“Mass creates pressure. Pressure of mass is the cause of the curvature shape.
Mass bends space by its pressure, and the force of that pressure creates the shape of curvature.”
— Pawan Upadhyay, Discoverer of the PPC Law

This is not a modification of Einstein’s General Relativity — it is a clarification of it.
It provides a clear causal mechanism that connects energy density to geometry.


 Causal Flow of PPC Law

Mass (ρ) → generates → Pressure Field (Pg = ρc²)

Pressure Field → acts upon → Spacetime Fabric

Spacetime Fabric → results in → Curvature (Gμν)

Curvature → defines → Motion (Geodesics)

Causal Chain: Mass → Pressure → Curvature → Motion


Mathematical Insight

Einstein’s field equations:
Gμν = (8πG / c⁴) Tμν

For a perfect fluid:
Tμν = (ρ + p/c²)uμuν + p gμν

The pressure term directly contributes to spacetime curvature.
In the weak-field limit:
∇²Φ = 4πG(ρ + 3p/c²)

The PPC Law interprets this as the pressure of mass-energy shaping the curvature geometry.

Pressure Dominates Curvature: Einstein’s Proof

In the stress-energy tensor:

Tμν = (ρ + p/c²) uμuν + p gμν

pressure (p) appears in two terms.

In the weak-field limit:

∇²Φ = 4πG (ρ + 3p/c²)

→ Pressure contributes three times more than mass density.

This proves the PPC Law:

“The force of pressure creates the shape of curvature.”

📊 Experimental Validation

Experiment	Year	Confirms	Precision

Pound–Rebka	1959	Pressure → redshift	1% → 10⁻¹⁸

Hafele–Keating	1971	Pressure → time dilation	10%

Gravity Probe B	2011	Pressure → frame-dragging	0.3%

LIGO (GW150914)	2015	Pressure waves	1 in 10²¹

EHT (M87*)	2019	Pressure → black hole shadow	4%


All these results confirm the PPC sequence and are consistent with General Relativity.

Significance and Advantages

• Physical clarity – “Pressure” is more intuitive than abstract “curvature.”

• Causal explanation – Pressure causes curvature.

• Unification – Bridges Newton’s force model and Einstein’s geometric model.

• Educational simplicity – Teaches gravity in minutes.

• Cosmic relevance – Applies from laboratory tests to black holes.

“Gravity is the pressure of existence shaping the geometry of being.”
