Pressure Waves in the PPC Law of Gravity (My New Discovery) :-
Pressure Waves are vibrations of the spacetime pressure field created by mass-energy variations.
They carry curvature energy through the universe and manifest as detectable gravitational waves.

Under this interpretation:

Gravity arises from pressure-induced curvature.
Gravitational waves are pressure waves in spacetime.
The PPC Law unifies mass, pressure, and curvature in a single causal chain.

Summary :-
“Gravitational waves are pressure waves in spacetime — vibrations of the universal pressure field created by mass.”
