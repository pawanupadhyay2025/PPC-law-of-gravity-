#PPC Predictions From

P_g = ω E_d.

When ω = 1, Then

P_g = E_d.



Then , PPC predicts:

✔ Strongest gravitational redshift

✔ Maximum time dilation

✔ Enhanced pressure-wave activity

✔ Larger curvature gradients

✔ Altered neutron-star mass limits

✔ Unique signatures in gravitational waves

✔ Early-universe ultra-fast expansion

These results emerge because pressure and energy density become identical geometric sources.


Summary

The equation-of-state parameter  is fundamental in PPC gravity, because it controls:

the pressure generated by energy density,

the strength of gravitational curvature,

the dynamical behavior of spacetime.


The special case :

P_g = E_d

represents the maximum-pressure gravitational regime, where curvature is dominated entirely by pressure. This is one of the key predictions and conceptual pillars of the PPC Law of Gravity.
