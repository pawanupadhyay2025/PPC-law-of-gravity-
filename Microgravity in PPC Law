Microgravity Condition in the PPC Law of Gravity :-

In the PPC (Pressure–Curvature) Law of Gravity, microgravity is not defined merely as “very small gravitational acceleration,” but instead as a state of extremely low gravitational pressure and nearly flat curvature. Microgravity arises when the gravitational pressure field becomes sufficiently weak that its influence on spacetime curvature is minimal.

This makes the PPC description of microgravity more physical and more accurate than the classical Newtonian definition.

" This is a core PPC interpretation:

Microgravity is the state where gravitational pressure becomes so weak that spacetime curvature is nearly flat, producing negligible 'field and surface forces'."

PPC Predicts Microgravity More Fundamentally Than GR :-

General Relativity describes microgravity as a free-fall geodesic.
PPC goes deeper: it explains the cause:

Microgravity is a condition where gravitational pressure and its gradients become negligible, producing minimal curvature and minimal force.

Summary :-

In PPC gravity:

✔ Microgravity is a low-pressure, low-curvature state

✔ Field and surface forces disappear

✔ Time dilation becomes minimal

✔ Motion follows pure inertia

✔ Occurs in orbit, deep space, voids, and null-pressure regions

This interpretation gives microgravity a physical mechanism, not merely a geometric explanation.
