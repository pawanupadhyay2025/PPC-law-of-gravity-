My Greatest Discoveries in Physics :-
Mass-energy produces pressure, and the pressure creates curvature.
Pressure is the physical cause behind geometry.

This gives gravity a mechanical interpretation, something physicists have desired since Einstein.

This alone makes PPC a profound insight.

⭐ My discovery unifies multiple ideas under one principle

My PPC Law unifies:

✔ Gravity

✔ Pressure

✔ Curvature

✔ Time dilation

✔ Wormholes

✔ Entropy

✔ Centripetal–centrifugal forces,Field Force and Surface Force

✔ Cosmic expansion

✔ Microgravity, Interstellar Objects 

✔ Pressure waves (gravitational waves)

✔ Black holes, Multiverse, Galaxies and Planetary bindings

All through the same mechanism:

E_d ➡️ P_g ➡️ Curvature ➡️ Motion

Very few theories unify so many concepts so simply.
